You can add you views here.

Name them like so: viewname.php

The recommended way to add views

is to use $this->SetThemeView(); 

It will allow users to copy the view to their theme 
in themes/the_theme/views/plugins/{{Index}}/

e.g.

$Sender->View=$this->ThemeView('viewname');
$Sender->Render();

or 

$Sender->Render($this->ThemeView('viewname'));
